# AI Rules for {{project-name}}

{{project-description}}

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for AI Support Level

#### I am an expert

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Documentation

#### AI Decision Log

- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Version Control

#### GitHub

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Architecture

#### Monorepo

- Configure workspace-aware tooling to optimize build and test processes
- Implement clear package boundaries with explicit dependencies between packages
- Use consistent versioning strategy across all packages (independent or lockstep)
- Configure CI/CD to build and test only affected packages for efficiency
- Implement shared configurations for linting, testing, and {{development_tooling}}
- Use code generators to maintain consistency across similar packages or modules

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Static analysis

#### ESLint

- Configure project-specific rules in .eslintrc to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Static analysis

#### Prettier

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration across all {{project_repositories}}
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and {{specific_excluded_patterns}}
- Set printWidth based on team preferences (80-120 characters) to improve code readability
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style

## Frontend

### Guidelines for Angular

#### Angular Coding Standards

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes instead of NgModules
- Implement signals for state management instead of traditional RxJS-based approaches
- Use the new inject function instead of constructor injection
- Implement control flow with @if, @for, and @switch instead of *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Use the new deferrable views for improved loading states
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Implement proper lazy loading with loadComponent and loadChildren

## Frontend

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## Backend

### Guidelines for .NET

#### Entity Framework

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}

## Backend

### Guidelines for .NET

#### ASP.NET

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints in .NET 6+ applications to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the mediator pattern with MediatR for decoupling request handling and simplifying cross-cutting concerns
- Use API controllers with model binding and validation attributes for {{complex_data_models}}
- Apply proper response caching with cache profiles and ETags for improved performance on {{high_traffic_endpoints}}
- Implement proper exception handling with ExceptionFilter or middleware to provide consistent error responses
- Use dependency injection with scoped lifetime for request-specific services and singleton for stateless services

## DevOps

### Guidelines for CI/CD

#### GitHub Actions

- Use actions/checkout@v4 to checkout code
- Use actions/setup-node@v4 to setup Node.js
- Use actions/setup-python@v5 to setup Python
- Use actions/setup-java@v4 to setup Java
- Use actions/setup-go@v5 to setup Go
- Use composite actions to reuse workflow steps across different workflows
- Implement caching for dependencies to speed up builds
- Use matrix builds for testing across {{platform_versions}}

## DevOps

### Guidelines for Containerization

#### Docker

- Use multi-stage builds to create smaller production images
- Implement layer caching strategies to speed up builds for {{dependency_types}}
- Use non-root users in containers for better security

## Database

### Guidelines for SQL

#### MySQL

- Use InnoDB storage engine for transactions and foreign key constraints
- Implement proper indexing strategies based on {{query_patterns}}
- Use connection pooling for better performance
